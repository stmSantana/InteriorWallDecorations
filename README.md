## Description v1.4
### New(1.4): My Pictures Feature ###
* Several new posters, picture frames, and photos have been added. They are white paper with nothing drawn on them, but MyPicturesMod.dll can display PNG files in the **Mods/WallMyPictures** folder on their surfaces. The downloaded WallMyPictures folder initially contains PNG files, but you can also replace them with other images by editing those PNG files. You can use different resolutions, but please keep the ratio of height to width. Also, do not change the file name.<br>

### Finding Items
- **Loot:** Currently the new item will be found while searching various locations, e.g. Workbench, PlasticBox, Locker.
- **Spawn:** I have also added spawns for all items in various locations. Those are guaranteed. e.g. QuonsetGasStation, Dam, CampOffice.
Also, some items can be crafted.<br>(**NOTE:** *Gearspawner spawns all gear only on the first visit to each location. In other words, all mod items will not spawn in locations you have already visited.*)

### Adding Items
Using the [DeveloperConsole](https://github.com/FINDarkside/TLD-Developer-Console) Items can be manually added to your inventory with the command `add <GearName>`.
(e.g. `add Wallposterch`)
The item is fully integrated into the console and will appear in the auto-complete when pressing tab.
